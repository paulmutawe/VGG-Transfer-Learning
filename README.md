# VGG-Transfer-Learning
Neural Network Deep learning and Computer Vision Project exploring the VGG architecture for transfer learning.

Freezing pre-trained weights and adding a final fully connectedd layer for linear regression classification.

Using the VGG architecture for feature extraction prior to utilising the model for a particular classification use-case from a kaggle dataset.
